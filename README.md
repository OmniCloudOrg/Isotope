## üöÄ Overview

ISOtope is a powerful, Rust-based CLI tool that makes ISO customization simple. With a clean JSON configuration format, ISOtope gives you complete control over building custom OS images while avoiding the complexity of traditional solutions.

```bash
isotope build config.json
```

Think of ISOtope as what Packer *should* have been: powerful automation without the headaches of HCL configuration and with greatly improved configurability.

## üìã Example Configuration

(see examples directory)

## üõ†Ô∏è Use Cases

ISOtope is designed for several key scenarios:

### Enterprise Deployment

Create standardized operating system images with pre-configured applications, security settings, and corporate policies for consistent deployment across thousands of workstations.

### Cloud Infrastructure

Build custom cloud images with specific configurations, packages, and optimizations for your infrastructure requirements.

### Development Environments

Craft reproducible development environments with all necessary tools, libraries, and configurations pre-installed.

### Automated Testing

Generate test environments with different OS configurations for comprehensive application testing.

### OmniCloud Use Case

At OmniCloud, we use ISOtope internally for automating Live VM ISO creation to support rapid mass-deployment of virtual machines. This allows us to:

- Reduce VM provisioning time from hours to minutes
- Ensure consistency across thousands of deployments
- Customize images on-the-fly based on customer requirements
- Maintain version control of our deployment configurations
- Automate testing of new releases before deployment
